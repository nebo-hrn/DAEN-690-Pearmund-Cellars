# DAEN 690: Wine Production Dashboard for Pearmund Cellars

As part of the Data Analytics Engineering Program at George Mason University, the DAEN 690 capstone course provides students with the opportunity to solve real world problems using the knowledge and skills gained from their course work. Our team, team Sommelier Analytics, was tasked with helping Pearmund Cellars and it's sister wineries forecast the quantity of wine to be produced next season. Our partners, Chris Pearmund and John Memomli, also wanted to better understand their data to help explain and quantify not only their business but the situtation surround the forcasted production.

To accomplish this a Wine Production Dashobard was created with Excel. This dashboard contains three things:
* A database to hold historical data and a process to input new data.
* Numerous business intelligence tools to draw key insights from the data and visualize them through tables and graphs.
* A pipeline to predict demand for their wines as well as to adjust the values based on the existing business situtation and inventory levels to forecast production.

#### Database

The database was a native function to Excel and required no extra implementation. Initial datasets were provided by the partners which were cleaned and transformed to meet the needs of the project and placed in seperate sheets on the dashboard. This allowed the dashboard to host all relevant and required data and allowed the other features to easily reference information. User input forms were also created so new data can be inputted.

To ensure privacy all proprietary data has been stripped from the dashboard. Examples of valid data forms are shown in each dataset.

#### Business Intelligence

Numerous Business Intelligence tools were created using VBA scripts and button controls, both native to Excel. The various scripts utilize user selections from drop-down lists to make proper selections on which dataset to use. These scripts also perform the necessary calculations and out the results in either a table or graph for easy visualization.
